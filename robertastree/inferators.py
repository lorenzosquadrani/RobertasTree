    Receive the output of a Tree object and return the probabilities associated to each class.

    Parameters
    ----------

    Elaborate the outputs of a RobertaTree model to infere the best value.

    Parameters
    ----------
      tree_outputs : torch.tensor
        Output of the Roberta Tree model. It is a tensor of shape (nclasses, batchsize,2)

      classes : dict
        Dictionary with classes' name as keys and tuple with class numerical interval as values

    Returns
    -------
      targets: torch.tensor
          The results of the regression, given by an average of the classes values,
